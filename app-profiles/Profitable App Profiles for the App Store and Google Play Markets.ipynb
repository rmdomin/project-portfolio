We will pretend we are working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, available in their respective stores. Our company only builds apps that are free to download and install, with our main source of revenue comprising in-app ads. The more users who see and engage with the ads, the higher our revenue. Our goal is to provide insight for developers on what kind of apps are likely to attract more users. \n",

The mass presence of games may be due to several factors: the appeal of games to people of all ages, the ease in ability to make a unique product of a game compared to other genres, and the number of genres within games themselves. Overall, it seems the App Store is filled with apps designed for fun. However, this is not enough to make a recommendation to developers.\n",

However, summed together, the number of games adds up to 940, and while it surpasses tools in presence, family is by far the most common. Many applications from every category are listed under the family genre. Altogether, the Google Play Store appears to be filled with a mix of practical and entertaining applications.\n",
