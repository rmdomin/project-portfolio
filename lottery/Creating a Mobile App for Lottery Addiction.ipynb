    "# Creating a Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to contribute to the making of a mobile app to combat lottery addiction. For the first version of the app, a medical institute wants us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that provide insight on the probability of winning in various scenarios such as:\n",
    "- Winning the big prize with a single ticket.\n",
    "- Winning the big prize with 40 different tickets (or any number of tickets).\n",
    "- Having at least a certain number (e.g. 5) winning numbers on a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider past data from the 6/49 lottery. We'll use a data set with data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018. The documentation for it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn, all ranging from 1 to 49, without replacement. Meaning, no set of numbers will have more than one of the same number within it. We'll start off by coding two functions:\n",
    "- A function that calculates factorials.\n",
